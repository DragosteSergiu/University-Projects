Class Transition: It is used to represent a transition between two states.
	- It has three fields, which are: state, value, and resultedState.
	- It has a getter and a setter for each field.
	- It has a to string method.


Class FiniteAutomata: It is the class the represents the automata.
	- It has five fields, which are: setOfStates, alphabet, initialState, setOfFinalStates, transitions.
	- It has  a getter and a setter for each field.
	- It has a to string method.
	- It contains the method which verifies if a given sequence is accepted by FA.

Class Handler: It is used to perform different kind of tasks.
	- It has one field, which is filename.
	- It has a function which creates an object of type 'FiniteAutomata', red from the file.
	- It has the method which prints the menu.
	- It contains the method which performs the interaction with the users.


The finite automata is stored in the file using this pattern:
Q = "{"state{, state}"}"
sigma = "{"value{, value}"}"
q0 = state
F = "{"state{, state}"}"
transitions = "{"
                "("state"," value")" "->" newstate";"
                {"("state"," value")" "->" newstate";"}
              "}"
