                <h1>Cluj-Napoca</h1>
                <p>Cluj-Napoca, commonly known as Cluj, is the fourth-most populous city in Romania.

                <h1>Rome</h1>
                <p> 
                    Rome is the capital city and a special comune of Italy (named Comune di Roma Capitale), 
                    as well as the capital of the Lazio region. The city has been a major human settlement for almost three millennia. 
                    With 2,860,009 residents in 1,285 km2 (496.1 sq mi), it is also the country's most populated comune. 
                    It is the third most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. 
                    It is the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome, which has a population of 4,355,725 residents, 
                    thus making it the most populous metropolitan city in Italy. Its metropolitan area is the third-most populous within Italy. 
                    Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of the Tiber. 
                    Vatican City (the smallest country in the world) is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome, 
                    the only existing example of a country within a city; for this reason Rome has sometimes been defined as the capital of two states.

                <h1>Buenos Aires</h1>
                <p>
                    Buenos Aires, officially Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, is the capital and largest city of Argentina. 
                    The city is located on the western shore of the Río de la Plata, on South America's southeastern coast. 
                    "Buenos Aires" can be translated as "fair winds" or "good airs", but the former was the meaning intended by the founders
                     in the 16th century, by the use of the original name "Real de Nuestra Señora Santa María del Buen Ayre", 
                     named after the Madonna of Bonaria in Sardinia, Italy.
                     The city of Buenos Aires is neither part of Buenos Aires Province nor the Province's capital; 
                     rather, it is an autonomous district. In 1880, after decades of political infighting, Buenos Aires was 
                     federalized and removed from Buenos Aires Province. The city limits were enlarged to include the towns of 
                     Belgrano and Flores; both are now neighborhoods of the city. The 1994 constitutional amendment granted the city 
                     autonomy, hence its formal name of Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires). 
                     Its citizens first elected a Chief of Government in 1996; previously, the Mayor was directly appointed by the 
                     President of Argentina.

                <h1>Rio de Janeiro</h1>
                <p>
                    Rio de Janeiro, or simply Rio, is the second-most populous city in Brazil and the sixth-most populous in the Americas. 
                    Rio de Janeiro is the capital of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's third-most populous state, 
                    after São Paulo and Minas Gerais. Part of the city has been designated as a World Heritage Site, 
                    named "Rio de Janeiro: Carioca Landscapes between the Mountain and the Sea", 
                    by UNESCO on 1 July 2012 as a Cultural Landscape.
                    Founded in 1565 by the Portuguese, the city was initially the seat of the Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro, 
                    a domain of the Portuguese Empire. Later, in 1763, it became the capital of the State of Brazil, a state of the 
                    Portuguese Empire. In 1808, when the Portuguese Royal Court transferred itself from Portugal to Brazil, 
                    Rio de Janeiro became the chosen seat of the court of Queen Maria I of Portugal, who subsequently, in 1815, 
                    under the leadership of her son, the prince regent, and future King João VI of Portugal, raised Brazil to 
                    the dignity of a kingdom, within the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and Algarves. Rio stayed the 
                    capital of the pluricontinental Lusitanian monarchy until 1822, when the War of Brazilian Independence began.
